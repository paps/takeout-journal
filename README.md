# takeout-journal

[GDPR article 20](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-20-gdpr/) forces companies to let you download your data in machine readable format. Most organizations (Google, Facebook...) respect this by letting you download big JSON or CSV files.

It's great to know what they know about you üëç but can't we exploit these files for something cool?

**‚áí This project will merge your exported data into a daily journal of your past life ü§Ø**
